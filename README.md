# MUON_SCATTERING_TOMOGRAPHY
This Project Deals With Imaging Nuclear Wastes Using Muon Scattering Tomography. A Machine Learning Algorithm POCA(Point of Closest Approach) is used for the primary part of this project for the imaging purpose.
A simulation is performed using GEANT4. A geometry is made in that simualtion and data is collected from that simulation.
The generated data is analysed using different algorithms of machine learning.
